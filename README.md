# POC with localstack

## ðŸŒª ðŸŒ§ ðŸŒ©

This project is a proof of concept using localstack as a mock AWS (cloud) to build a basic data ingestion infra using Terraform.

## Topology

This infra is intended to create a Firehose delivery stream connected to an S3 bucket.

An external application will put records to Firehose and the S3 bucket will receive buffered and gzipped objects.

$ docker-compose up -d
```

Create the infra.

```sh
# go to this folder
$ cd terraform/

# build it
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
